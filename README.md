# About

An educational game for visual proficiency

- two game modes: single and multiplayer (up to 4)
- four difficulty levels: Beginner I, Beginner II, Novice, Expert



## Potential Startup Idea

Currently looking into a one stop platform that:

- provides training on cognitive skills through game play
- gives personalised feedback and suggestions for improvement based on accumulated play

To be expanded to more aspects of cognitive skills, not just limiting to visual proficiency:

- deductive reasoning
- inductive reasoning
- numerical reasoning
- etc

## Potential Markets

1. Companies
   - can be catered to fit companies' ideal type of employee they are looking to recruit
   - provide cognitive training for existing employees
2. Education Institutes
   - platform for students to train these skills in preparation for job interviews that have such online tests as the first test
   - many are unable to get pass the first stage, hence this idea
3. Any individual
   - parents would want such stuff for their kids am i right

However the current idea of having hardware component is not exactly feasible

- looking into AR/VR components

# Prototype

## Game Interface 

[Adobe Xd](https://xd.adobe.com/view/0289e485-b621-49d9-51f0-47c2d7748d81-74b8/?fullscreen&hints=off)

- not all buttons are functional because no time to build all frames

For a full run through:

- selecting number of players: 4
- entering username: click on return key on the keyboard
- to explore the dynamic leaderboards, open [R-Shiny App](https://yingxuan0806.shinyapps.io/final/) 

## R-Shiny

Two components: 

1. Leaderboards
2. Personal Progress Dashboard Tracker

- fully functional [R-Shiny App](https://yingxuan0806.shinyapps.io/final/)
- takes some seconds to load bc poor runtime (no time no time)

A future enhancement on the personal user dashboard is to provide feedback to the users on the different aspects - what they have done well and what they can improve on
